# Hackathon_Churn_analysis
This is the code me and my team used during the BSDS (Bocconi students for data science) Hackathon 
In the 'BSDS November Hackathon.pdf' file you will find the rules, the dataset in under the name of 'BSDS_November.csv' and the actual code we used is in the Jupyter file 'November_Hackathon_BSDS.ipynb'
